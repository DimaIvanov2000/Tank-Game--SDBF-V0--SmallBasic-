# Tank Game, a.k.a. Super Duper Boss Fight V0 (SmallBasic)

A video game made using the graphical capabilities of Microsoft SmallBasic in which the player is a tank and must shoot and defeat an enemy without getting hit.

## How to Run
For this program to run, it is highly recommended that it is run using Microsoft SmallBasic as it is unknown how it will run otherwise. Optimization has not been accounted for, meaning that there are severe performance issues on most devices.

## Gameplay

The player controls a tank which is moved using WASD, can aim by pointing the mouse cursor, and can fire when holding down the mouse button. The goal of the game is to damage the main enemy (thing) while avoiding seeking energy orbs that become more numerous as the fight progresses. The player loses after being hit 3 times and has a small window of recovery when hit.  
  
All graphical assets used for this game were made from scratch in Microsoft Paint.

### Issues

The speed of the game is determined by the processing power of the device it is run on with many devices experiencing major slowdown. SmallBasic is meant for those new to programming and is not much in the way of efficiency.
